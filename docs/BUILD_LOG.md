## G0 — Workspaces, CI, and conventions (2026-09-28)

**Branch:** `claude/gifted-hypatia-x158zw` (the cloud session was pinned to this branch, so G0 onward share it; each session is its own commit series).

**Shipped**
- npm workspaces: `packages/catalog`, `packages/engine`, `packages/cli`, `apps/web` (`@homestead/*`). Packages export TypeScript source directly (`main: src/index.ts`), so there is no package build step; Vite, Vitest, and `tsx` consume the source.
- TypeScript 5.9 strict (`tsconfig.base.json`, plus `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`), ESLint 9 flat config with typescript-eslint, Prettier, Vitest 3 at the root, Playwright 1.56 in `tests/e2e`.
- Engine purity is enforced by ESLint: `no-restricted-imports` (react, react-dom, pixi.js, zustand, apps/*), `no-restricted-properties` (`Math.random`, `Date.now`), and `no-restricted-globals` (window, document, localStorage) on `packages/engine/**`. `packages/engine/test/purity.test.ts` lints probe snippets to prove the rule fires.
- Spreadsheet committed at `data/source/LandLab_Sim_Systems_v2.xlsx` (first commit). `data/catalog_overrides.json` created empty.
- `apps/web`: Vite + React smoke page, titled **TERRA Homestead Plugin**, showing the engine version (proves the workspace link).
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: `npm ci`, typecheck, lint, catalog check, vitest, Playwright Chromium install, web build, e2e against `vite preview`, screenshot artifact upload.
- Root scripts: `dev`, `build`, `test`, `test:e2e`, `typecheck`, `lint`, `catalog:export`, `catalog:check` (placeholders until G1), `sim`.

**Tests:** 5 unit (version + 4 purity probes), 1 e2e smoke. Screenshot: `docs/screenshots/g0/smoke.png`.

**Known gaps**
- `git push` from the sandbox returned 403 (the Claude GitHub App has no access to the repo yet); work is committed locally and pushed once access is fixed, so CI has not run remotely yet.
- `xlsx@0.18.5` is the last SheetJS release on the npm registry and has open advisories (prototype pollution, ReDoS). It only ever parses our own committed spreadsheet at export time and never ships in the web bundle.
